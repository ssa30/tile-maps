CO552 Coursework Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For this assessment, you need to use Git to clone this repository to your computer.
Then you need to make changes to the repository and use Git to commit and push those 
changes back to the repository.

There are two parts for this assignment.

1. Demonstrate that you can access the contents of a repository using Git (by cloning 
the Git repository to your local computer).

2. Demonstrate that you can successfully change the contents of a repository and commit 
the changes made using Git (by adding a new file to the Git repository).

You MUST complete both parts to pass the assessment.

The deadline for this coursework is Friday 4th December 2020, 23:55. Any edits made to the 
assignment repository after this deadline will not be graded for the coursework.

Instructions (also available in the PDF document):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	*	Using your preferred Git GUI/Command Line Interface, clone THIS Git repository to 
        your local computer.
		** Consult the Git lecture/class if you need help doing this.

	* 	Open the CO552_Assignment2_Instructions.pdf file in the repository you have 
        cloned, which gives detailed instructions of what is required for the assessment 
        and the steps to complete.

	* 	Step 1: Generate the tile map image
		Follow the link in the PDF file to the Moodle quiz, and use the password in the 
        PDF to access the quiz. The quiz provides information on how to generate the image.
		
		PLEASE NOTE: you will need to be connected to the VPN to access the resource to 
        generate the tile map image.

	*	Step 2: Screenshot and save the tile map image
		Once you have generated the tile map from the online resource (found in the 
        quiz), create a screenshot and save this as an image file to the tile-maps folder
        in the repository saved to your local computer. 
        Please see the PDF document if you need help on how to take a screenshot.
		
		PLEASE NOTE: It is strongly recommended that you make the file name of the saved 
        image file your login as this is less likely to result in a conflict.

        I have saved an example file with the filename ka470.png. You can use other 
        image file extensions (e.g. bmp, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, .png).
        
	*	Step 3: Upload your Image to the Quiz
		Remember to also upload your image file to the quiz and submit the quiz to 
        complete it.
	
	*	Step 4: Commit and push the change to the repository
		Commit the changes (your added image file) and push your changes to the repository
		
		It is strongly recommended that you do a 'pull' operation after committing, and 
        before you do a push operation, in case someone else was editing the project at 
        the same time as you. Otherwise this may result in a "merge conflict. Git may 
        refuse to accept the commit: in that case either refer back to the lecture/class 
        for what you need to do, or contact Kemi Ademoye (k.ademoye@kent.ac.uk) if you are 
        having problems fixing this.
	
	*	Important
		Note that you will not be eligible for any marks - until you commit and push your 
        repository edits successfully (the upload of the tile map image to the tile-maps 
        folder).

		You would be wise to check that your changes have been pushed successfully to the 
        remote repository by visiting it in a web browser. 
		
		If any other files have been added, edited or deleted (other than the screenshot) 
        as a result of your committing to the repository, you will have been deemed NOT to 
        have completed the git operations successfully, unless you can correct them and 
        return them to the appropriate state.

	
Marking Scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This assignment is pass/fail. You will score 100% for this assessment if you complete the 
quiz (i.e. demonstrate you can access the contents of an existing repository) AND 
successfully commit and push your screenshot of the tile map image to the tile-maps 
folder, without making any unintended changes to the repository (i.e. demonstrate you can 
make changes to the content of a repository using version control).
