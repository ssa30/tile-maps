Coursework instructions
-----------------------

For this assessment, you need to use Git to clone this repository to 
your computer, to receive information from the repository. Then you need 
to make changes to the repository then use Git to commit and push those 
changes back to the repository.

There are two parts for this assessment: 

1. Demonstrate that you can access the contents of a repository using Git (by 
retrieving a password that complete a quiz on Moodle).

2. Demonstrate that you can change the contents of a repository using 
Git (by adding a file to the repository).

You must complete both parts to pass the assessment.

The deadline for this coursework is Friday 6th December, 23:55. Any edits made 
to the assignment repository after this deadline will not be counted for the 
coursework. 

Instructions:

    * Using TortoiseGit or some other Git GUI/command Line interface, clone 
    THIS Git repository to some directory/folder accessible to you. 
        ** Consult the Git lecture/class if you need help doing this.
    
    * Open the Electrical_Safety_Training powerpoint slides. 
    
    * Open the Electrical_safety_training_link PDF file.
    
    * Follow the link in the PDF to the moodle quiz, and use the password in 
    the PDF to access the quiz.
    
    * Complete the Electrical safety training quiz, with reference to the slides 
    from the repository. You can take as many attempts as you like to complete 
    the quiz.
    
    * Once you have finished the quiz, take a screenshot of the Summary page 
    for the quiz on Moodle, showing the grade that you have got for the quiz.
    
    * Save this screenshot in the completedQuiz folder on your local copy of 
    the repository, saving it with your username as the filename. For example, 
    Anna has saved an example of this file with the filename akj22.png (or 
    whatever image file extension your screenshot saves as).  
        ** [To take a screenshot on the university machines 
      or another Windows machine, hold down Shift and press Print Screen; 
      this will make a copy of the screen. To save the screenshot, you could use 
      the Paint software: open a New window in Paint, and do CONTROL-V to paste 
      your copied screenshot into the new window. If you are using a machine with 
      a different operating system, use software such as the Grab/Screenshot 
      utility on Mac to take the screenshot and save it].
    
    * Commit and push your changed file back to the remote repository. 
        ** We STRONGLY 
      recommend you do a 'pull' operation after committing, and before you do a 
      push operation, in case someone else was editing the file at the same time 
      as you. Otherwise this may result in a "merge conflict": Git may refuse to 
      accept the commit: in that case either refer back to the lecture/class 
      for what you need to do, or contact Anna Jordanous 
      a.k.jordanous@kent.ac.uk ASAP if you are having problems fixing this. 
    
    * Note that you will not be eligible for any marks - until you commit and 
    push your repository edits successfully (the upload of your screenshot to 
      the completedQuiz folder). 
      ** You would be wise to check that your changes have been pushed 
      successfully to the remote repository by visiting it in a web browser. 
      If any other files have been added, edited or deleted other than student 
      screenshots, as a result of your committing to the repository, you will 
      have been deemed NOT to have completed the git operations successfully, 
      unless you can correct them and return them to the appropriate state. 
      ** Remember that all changes to the repository are logged with the 
      username of the person who has made that change.

Marking scheme:
----------------
This assignment is pass/fail. You will score 100% for this assessment if you 
complete the quiz (i.e. demonstrate you can access the contents of an existing
repository) AND successfully commit and push your screenshot of the quiz results
to the completedQuiz folder, without making any unintended changes to the 
repository (i.e. demonstrate you can make changes to the content of a 
repository using version control).
